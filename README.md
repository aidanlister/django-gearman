django-gearman
==============

*django-gearman* is a convenience wrapper for the [Gearman][Gearman]
[Python Bindings][python-gearman].

With django-gearman, you can code jobs as well as clients in a Django project
with minimal overhead in your application. Server connections etc. all take
place in django-gearman and don't unnecessarily clog your application code.

[Gearman]: http://gearman.org
[python-gearman]: http://github.com/samuel/python-gearman

Installation
------------
It's the same for both the client and worker instances of your django project:

    pip install -e git://github.com/fwenzel/django-gearman.git#egg=django-gearman

Add ``django_gearman`` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` section of `settings.py`.

Specify the following settings in your local settings.py file:

    # One or more gearman servers
    GEARMAN_SERVERS = ['127.0.0.1']

    # gearman job name pattern. Namespacing etc goes here. This is the pattern
    # your jobs will register as with the server, and that you'll need to use
    # when calling them from a non-django-gearman client.
    # replacement patterns are:
    # %(app)s : django app name the job is filed under
    # %(job)s : job name
    GEARMAN_JOB_NAME = '%(app)s.%(job)s'

Workers
-------
### Registering jobs
Create a file `gearman_jobs.py` in any of your django apps, and define as many
jobs as functions as you like. The jobs must accept a single argument as
passed by the caller and must return the result of the operation, if
applicable. (Note: It must accept an argument, even if you don't use it).

If you need to pass python objects or multiple arguments, you must first
`pickle` them.

Mark each of these functions as gearman jobs by decorating them with
`django_gearman.decorators.gearman_job`.

For an example, look at the `gearman_example` app's `gearman_jobs.py` file.

### Starting a worker
To start a worker, run `python manage.py gearman_worker`. It will start
serving all registered jobs.

To spawn more than one worker (if, e.g., most of your jobs are I/O bound),
use the `-w` option:

    python manage.py gearman_worker -w 5

will start five workers.

Since the process will keep running while waiting for and executing jobs,
you probably want to run this in a _screen_ session or similar.

Clients
-------
To make your workers work, you need a client app passing data to them. Create
and instance of the `django_gearman.GearmanClient` class and execute it:

    from django_gearman import DjangoGearmanClient
    client = DjangoGearmanClient()
    sentence = "Simple Example"
    completed_job_request = client.submit_job("gearman_example.reverse", sentence))
    print "Result: '%s'" % completed_job_request.result

The notation for the task name is `appname.jobname`, no matter what pattern
you have defined in `GEARMAN_JOB_NAME`.

Dispatching a background event without waiting for the result is easy as well:

    completed_job_request = client.submit_job("gearman_example.reverse", wait_until_complete=False))

For a live example look at the `gearman_example` app, in the
`management/commands/gearman_example_client.py` file.

For more information, see the gearman documentation:
http://packages.python.org/gearman/

Example App
-----------
For a full, working, example application, add `gearman_example` to your
`INSTALLED_APPS`, then run a worker in one shell:

    python manage.py gearman_worker -w 4

and execute the example app in another:

    python manage.py gearman_example_client

You can see the client sending data and the worker(s) working on it.
